Did the GIT is useful to the programmers and
Developers? Yes/No and why?
Ans: yes it because Git is the most commonly 
used version control system. Git tracks the change
you make to files, so you have a record of
 what has been done, and you can revert to
 specific versions should you ever need to. 
Git also makes collaboration easier, 
allowing changes by multiple people to all
 be merged into one source.
